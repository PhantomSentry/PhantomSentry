# 👻 PhantomSentry

> SOC After Dark | Detection Engineering | Adversary Simulation

Welcome to **PhantomSentry** — a blue-team research space focused on how attacks actually appear in **logs, alerts, and telemetry** when the lights are off and defenders are under pressure.

This project is built around one core idea:

**Security is about thinking, not tools.**

---

## 🌙 SOC After Dark

**SOC After Dark** is the primary project hosted here.

It simulates real-world attack scenarios alongside **normal behavior**, helping defenders learn how to tell the difference — the skill that matters most in real SOC work.

Instead of simply labeling activity as “malicious”, the labs show:

- What *normal* logs look like  
- What *attacker* activity looks like  
- Why detections trigger (or fail)  
- How analysts should reason during investigations  

Think of it as **offensive realism for defensive minds**.
