Blue Team | SOC | Detection Engineering | Threat Hunting

I build security challenges and labs focused on **real-world detection failures**, not toy exploits.

### 🧠 Focus Areas
- SOC Operations & Incident Triage
- Detection Logic (SIEM / Sentinel-style)
- Threat Hunting & Endpoint Analysis
- Authentication & Identity Failures
- CVE Context & Risk Validation

### 🛡️ Featured Project
🔹 **SOC After Dark**  
A Jeopardy-style CTF built from real SOC scenarios:
- WAF bypasses
- JWT auth flaws
- Detection logic failures
- PowerShell threat hunting
- CVE misinterpretation

👉 Coming soon / In progress

> Tools change. Logic doesn’t.
