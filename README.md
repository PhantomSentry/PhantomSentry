SOC After Dark | Detection Engineering | Adversary Simulation

Welcome to PhantomSentry — a security research space focused on how attacks actually look in logs, alerts, and telemetry when the lights are off and attackers are active.

This profile is built to document:

Realistic attack vs normal behavior

SOC-ready logs and detections

Blue-team thinking behind alerts

Hands-on labs and simulations anyone can try

🧠 Who Am I?

I’m a security practitioner with a strong focus on:

Security Operations (SOC)

Incident Response

Detection Engineering

Adversary emulation

Log analysis (Microsoft Defender, Sentinel, Windows, network)

I believe security should be explainable, testable, and practical — not just dashboards and buzzwords.

🌙 What is SOC After Dark?

SOC After Dark is a collection of labs and write‑ups that simulate real-world attack scenarios and the corresponding normal behavior — so defenders can learn the difference.

Instead of just saying “this is malicious”, the project shows:

What normal logs look like

What attacker activity looks like

Why detections trigger (or fail)

How analysts should reason during investigations

Think of it as offensive realism for defensive minds.

🔥 Why This Project Exists

Modern SOCs suffer from:

Alert fatigue

Poor understanding of log context

Over‑reliance on vendor detections

This project exists to:

Teach log intuition

Improve analyst confidence

Bridge the gap between red and blue teams

Provide open, reusable learning material

Everything here is designed to be:

Open source

Beginner‑friendly but analyst‑relevant

Useful in interviews, training, and real SOC work
